This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Test to implement Page Transition using Animate Presence with NextJS App router.

It is based on Oliver Larose [Page Transition tutorial](https://blog.olivierlarose.com/articles/nextjs-page-transition-guide)

The workaround is based on this thread: https://stackoverflow.com/a/77715364
